### **Take-Home Assignment: Data Review, Editor, and Exporter**

**Approach**: First, I implemented the data query using a fetch call. After confirming that I could retrieve the data correctly, I started implementing the table by first displaying the basic text elements in each column. Next, I implemented the "Error Summary" modal on button click, separating the error details based on severity. Afterwards, I color-coded each column based on severity by coloring its background color. I figured this would be the easiest way to display this information in a minimalistic way. Second to last, I implemented hoverable tooltips by using the built-in tooltips in material-tailwind since tailwindCSS was already installed. Finally, I implemented CSV export by stringifying the errors and using react-csv to download the CSV.

**Assumptions**: I assumed that all records would have the same keys, namely the column headers, so I used the keys of the first record as the table headers.

**Improvements**: Functionality-wise, I would implement pagination so that for large data, the data would not be retrieved or displayed all at once. This would improve load time and usability. Design-wise, I would add arrows to the tooltips to further signify which cell it is pointing towards. I would also use icons for the validation errors with the hover for the tooltip since this is less distracting and more user friendly in the UX sense. I would also make the table scrollable and make the first row sticky to the top of the page.

**Objective**: Build a data review interface that queries JSON data from a Next.js API, displays the data in a table format with validation errors, and allows users to export the data in CSV format. You will also color-code validation errors and provide error details in an interactive way.

**Deliverables**:

1. **Data Query from API**: Implement a Next.js API route that returns the provided mock JSON data (attached below).
2. **Data Review Table**:
   - Display the data in a table, flattening any nested fields (e.g., `address`) into separate columns (e.g., `Street`, `City`, `Zipcode`).
   - Color-code validation errors in each column according to severity:
     - Red for critical errors (must be fixed).
     - Yellow for warnings (should be reviewed).
     - Green for valid fields.
   - **Hoverable Error Messages**: Each cell with a validation error should display the error message on hover as a tooltip.
   - **Error Summary Modal**: Include an "Error Summary" modal with a clickable button or link that opens a modal. This modal should list all the validation errors for that specific row, with details for each error.
3. **CSV Export**: Allow users to export the data to a CSV format.

**Design Considerations**:

- **No Figma Provided**: We have deliberately not provided Figma or design assets for this project. This is to give you the freedom to design the table and modals as you see fit. Part of the evaluation will be based on your ability to create a user-friendly, intuitive UI without strict design guidelines. You're free to choose the best layout, color schemes, and UX patterns, and UI Libraries that fit the task.

**Mock Data**: You will be working with the following mock JSON data. The data will always follow a static model. Your API should serve this data to the frontend:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "New York",
      "zipcode": "12345",
      "phone": "123-456-7890",
      "status": "active",
      "errors": {
        "phone": {
          "message": "Invalid phone format",
          "severity": "critical"
        },
        "zipcode": {
          "message": "Invalid zipcode",
          "severity": "warning"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@sample",
      "street": "456 Elm St",
      "city": "Los Angeles",
      "zipcode": "",
      "phone": "987-654-3210",
      "status": "inactive",
      "errors": {
        "email": {
          "message": "Invalid email format",
          "severity": "critical"
        },
        "zipcode": {
          "message": "Zipcode is missing",
          "severity": "critical"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com",
      "street": "",
      "city": "Chicago",
      "zipcode": "60614",
      "phone": "111-222-3333",
      "status": "pending",
      "errors": {
        "street": {
          "message": "Street address is missing",
          "severity": "warning"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expectations**:

- **Tech Stack**: Use **Next.js** for API and server-side rendering, React for frontend components. Styling can be done with **Tailwind CSS** or your **UI library of choice**.
- **Time Estimation**: This assignment should take 4â€“6 hours to complete.
- **Submission**: Please fork this repo, and provide a GitHub repo link containing your code, with a README explaining your approach, assumptions, and any improvements you would make given more time.
